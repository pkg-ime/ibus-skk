** Compatility fix for older IBus versions.
Run-time check for new IBus features are added, such as candidate

* Version 0.0.3 (released 2009-12-31)

** Shortcut key to move over pages of the candidate window.
Up/Down (if the orientation is landscape) are assigned to move over
pages rather than candidates.  x/space behave similarly after the
first 4 candidates are seen.

** Show annotations on the auxilary text area.

** Start conversion automatically when some punctuation characters are typed.
Thanks iws <iws1011@gmail.com> for the initial implementation.

** RPM spec file is included in the distribution.
Contributed by Jens Petersen <petersen@redhat.com>.

** Support for encodings other than EUC-JP for the user dictionary.
The encoding of the user dictionary is determined by an Emacs-like
coding cookie (something like ";;; -*- coding: utf-8 -*-").

** Elisp candidates evaluation.
IBus-SKK calls emacsclient to evaluate elisp candidates (such as
"(current-time-string)" for "now") with the help of external Emacs
process.
